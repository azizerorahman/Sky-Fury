# Sky Fury — Design Notes (Initial)

This doc contains a summary of the design and next steps for implementation.

- Implement quadtree and FSM after core mechanics are stable.
- Placeholder art will be replaced by actual sprites later; code draws primitives when images are missing.
- Later tasks: power-ups, bosses, particle system, audio integration.
